## Project Structure
* Create multiple JSP files for different parts of the user interface, including forms for displaying, creating, editing, and deleting data. All JSP files will be in the WEB-INF directory to ensure the application is secure, well-organized, and adheres to the principles of the MVC architecture
* Map controller methods to the JSP files to allow proper handling and processing of HTTP requests
* DAO interface and implementation. Define methods for C.R.U.D operations and implement the DAO interface using JDBC

## Technologies Used
* Github
* Terminal
* Eclipse Spring Tool Suite
* Spring model view controller
* Data access object
* Jakarta server pages

## Lessons Learned
* Working as a team. Communication is key when working together in a group project. Before writing any code, we established our game plan and assigned roles for which part of the project each person would work on. This streamlined our building process and allowed us to work more efficiently. To keep both team members updated, we communicated any time we made changes and pushed to Github
